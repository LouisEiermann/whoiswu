# Three Poisons Mapping

Purpose: split reactive pattern into greed, hate, and ignorance.

Activation rule:
- Show poison pie only when Delusion Meter > 50.
- If Delusion Meter <= 50, set all poisons to 0 and hide pie.

Poison interpretation:
- Greed: craving, possession, status hunger, merit-hoarding.
- Hate: aggression, contempt, punitive intent, dehumanizing tone.
- Ignorance: confusion, reification, misreading emptiness/non-attachment.

Output rule:
- greed + hate + ignorance = 100 when active.
- Each poison must have a direct textual reason.
