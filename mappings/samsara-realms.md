# Saṃsāra Realm Mapping

Purpose: psychological placement of each speaker across six realms plus a Nirvana/Buddha placement.

Allowed realms:
- nirvana: beyond six-realm push-pull; highly non-attached, lucid, compassionate
- naraka: hell-realm dynamics (harm, cruelty, destructive hatred)
- preta: hungry-ghost dynamics (insatiable craving, exploitative hunger)
- animal: confusion/habit dynamics (reactive, unreflective, conditioned loops)
- human: mixed dynamics (self-awareness and confusion both present)
- asura: demi-god dynamics (anger, competitiveness, domination, power games)
- deva: god-realm dynamics (ease, generosity, compassion, low grasping)

Interpretation hints:
- Nirvana is ultra-rare and should require exceptionally clear, non-grasping dynamics:
  very high insight, very low delusion, and near-zero poison profile.
- Never award Nirvana by identity/name; only by observed mind-pattern in the transcript.
- If clear but not exceptional, prefer Deva over Nirvana.
- Naraka rises with extreme hate and intent to harm.
- Preta rises with manipulative craving and exploitative appetite.
- Asura rises with rivalry, anger, and status combat.
- Animal is the better fit for "clueless NPC" patterns: low hate, high confusion, habitual grasping.
- Deva rises with compassionate, non-attached, non-defensive speech.
- Human is the midpoint when mixed signals dominate.
