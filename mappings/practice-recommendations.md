# Practice Recommendation Mapping

Purpose: suggest practical Buddhist training that fits the participant's current pattern.

Guidelines:
- Keep recommendations concrete and small (2-4 actions).
- Blend direct practice (zazen / mindfulness), study (sutra reading), and conduct (ethics/compassion).
- Avoid shaming. Match intensity to current delusion/reactivity.

Suggested mapping:
- Nirvana/very clear: stabilization + compassionate activity, anti-pride guard.
- Deva/high clarity: maintain practice, avoid subtle attachment to insight.
- Asura/Naraka/high hate: calming and compassion-first protocols before deep metaphysics.
- Preta/high greed: contentment and generosity training, anti-craving routines.
- Animal/high ignorance: study + sitting structure to reduce confusion loops.
- Human/mixed: balanced daily triad (sit, study, serve).
