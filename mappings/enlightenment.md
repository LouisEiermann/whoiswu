# Chance Of Enlightenment Mapping

Purpose: rough meme estimate of direct non-attached understanding in this exchange.

- 0-5: Inanimate Object
- 6-20: Temple Courtyard Dust
- 21-40: Koan Tourist
- 41-60: Meditation Intern
- 61-80: Half-Step Through The Gateless Gate
- 81-95: Bodhidharma-Coded
- 96-100: Mountain Hermit Final Boss

Interpretation hints:
- Higher when speech is direct, compassionate, and non-grasping.
- Lower when speech is defensive, performative, and status-attached.
